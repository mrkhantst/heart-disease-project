# Heart Disease Prediction
A machine learning model to predict heart disease posibility based on medical attributes.

It is a great project for my machine learning career. Feel free to give it a try.

## Dependencies
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Sckikit-Learn

## Descriptions

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem defination
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

### 1. Problem Definition

In a statement,
> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether they have heart disease?

### 2. Dataset Preparation

The original data came from the Clavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

There is also a verion of it avaliable on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/heart-disease-uci/data

### 3. Evaluation

> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll purse the project.

### 4. Features

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.

**Create data dictionary**

* age. The age of the patient.
* sex. The gender of the patient. (1 = male, 0 = female).
* cp. Type of chest pain. (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non — anginal pain, 4 = asymptotic).
* trestbps. Resting blood pressure in mmHg.
* chol. Serum Cholestero in mg/dl.
* fbs. Fasting Blood Sugar. (1 = fasting blood sugar is more than 120mg/dl, 0 = otherwise).
* restecg. Resting ElectroCardioGraphic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy).
* thalach. Max heart rate achieved.
* exang. Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
* oldpeak. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
* slope. Peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).
* ca. Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy.
* thal. Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).
* num. Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = absence, 1, 2, 3, 4 = present).
